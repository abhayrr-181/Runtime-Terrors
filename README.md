## 📋 Abstract

**Help Me Say No to Phishing** is an AI-powered assistant that detects phishing attempts across multiple sources—emails, messages, screenshots, and URLs—and provides users with simple, actionable guidance. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), URL validation, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to analyze content and warn users if it is suspicious. Instead of just flagging risks, it educates and guides users to respond safely, thereby preventing fraud and increasing digital awareness.

## 🚀 Proposed Features

### 🎯 Core Detection Capabilities
- **Multi-input Detection**: Paste a URL, paste email/SMS text, or upload screenshot (OCR)
- **Heuristic Risk Scoring**: Explainable rules (shorteners, IP hosts, urgent wording, missing HTTPS)
- **Simple Safety Guidance**: Easy-to-understand safety guidance for every detection
- **Dashboard with Results**: Clear categorization - Safe, Suspicious, Phishing

### 🤖 AI-Powered Analysis
- **Real-time Pattern Recognition**: Detects urgency tactics, authority impersonation, and social engineering
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Provides educational guidance with source citations
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Handles text, URLs, and images seamlessly

## 🛠️ Tools, Technologies & Platforms

### Frontend
- **React.js** + **Tailwind CSS** - Simple, responsive UI
- **Next.js 14** - Full-stack React framework
- **Lucide React** - Modern icon library

### Backend & AI
- **FastAPI (Python)** - High-performance phishing detection API
- **Hugging Face Inference API** - ML model integration

### ML/NLP & Analysis
- **Scikit-learn** - TF-IDF + Naive Bayes for phishing classification
- **Tesseract OCR** - Screenshot text extraction
- **Heuristic Rules Engine** - Lightweight, explainable detection


### Database (Optional)
- **SQLite** - Lightweight local database for caching

## 🆕 Novelty / Uniqueness

### What makes our solution different from existing solutions?

1. Comprehensive Multi-Input Analysis: Most phishing detection tools focus only on emails or URLs. Our solution supports multi-input analysis: text, URLs, and screenshots.

2. Lightweight ML Models: No heavy external APIs → works offline and during demos, making it perfect for educational environments and resource-constrained scenarios.

3. **Educational Focus**: Instead of just flagging risks, we educate and guide users to respond safely, building long-term digital awareness.

4. **Extensible Architecture**: Designed to be extended as a browser plugin or mobile app in the future, providing flexibility for different deployment scenarios.

5. **Explainable AI**: Heuristic risk scoring with explainable rules, helping users understand why something is flagged as suspicious.

## 🌍 Expected Impact / Use Case
